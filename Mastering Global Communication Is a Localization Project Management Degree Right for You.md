## What is Localization Project Management?

Localization project management involves overseeing the process of adapting a product or service to a specific target market. This goes far beyond simple translation; it encompasses cultural adaptation, linguistic accuracy, technical adjustments, and ensuring the overall user experience feels native to the target audience. Imagine launching a video game globally. A localization project manager would be responsible for not just translating the dialogue, but also adapting the graphics to reflect local customs, ensuring the game complies with local regulations, and even adjusting gameplay mechanics to suit different cultural preferences.

A localization project manager acts as a central hub, coordinating a team of translators, editors, designers, engineers, and testers to ensure the final product is culturally appropriate and functionally sound. They manage timelines, budgets, and quality control throughout the entire localization lifecycle.

## Why Consider a Localization Project Management Degree?
