## Example Assessment Questions (and How to Approach Them)

To give you a better idea of what to expect, here are some example assessment questions and how to approach them:

**Question 1:** Write a function that takes a player's name as input and prints a personalized welcome message to the chat.

**Approach:**

```lua
local function welcomePlayer(playerName)
  game.Players:Chat(playerName .. ", welcome to the game!")
end

welcomePlayer("YourNameHere") -- Example usage
```

**Question 2:** Create a script that detects when a player touches a specific part and changes the part's color.

**Approach:**

```lua
local part = game.Workspace.MyPart

local function onPartTouched(otherPart)
  local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(otherPart.Parent)
  if player then
    part.BrickColor = BrickColor.random()
  end
end

part.Touched:Connect(onPartTouched)
```

**Question 3:** Implement a simple data persistence system that saves and loads a player's score.

**Approach:**

```lua
local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
local playerDataStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("PlayerData")

local function loadPlayerData(player)
  local userId = player.UserId
  local data = playerDataStore:GetAsync(userId)

  if data then
    player.leaderstats.Score.Value = data.score or 0 -- Default score if no data
  else
    player.leaderstats.Score.Value = 0 -- Default to 0 score if no data exists
  end
end

local function saveData(player)
  local userId = player.UserId
  local data = {
    score = player.leaderstats.Score.Value
  }
  pcall(function()
    playerDataStore:SetAsync(userId, data)
  end)
end

game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    --Creates the Leaderstats Folder and Score Value
    local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
    leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"
    leaderstats.Parent = player

    local score = Instance.new("IntValue")
    score.Name = "Score"
    score.Value = 0
    score.Parent = leaderstats
    loadPlayerData(player) --Load the Player's data upon joining
end)

game.Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(saveData)

game:BindToClose(function()
	for i, player in pairs(game.Players:GetPlayers()) do
		saveData(player)
	end
end)
```

These examples illustrate the types of questions you might encounter and the coding skills you'll need to demonstrate. Remember to approach each question methodically, break it down into smaller steps, and test your code thoroughly.
