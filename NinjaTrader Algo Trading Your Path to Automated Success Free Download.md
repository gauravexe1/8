## What is NinjaTrader Algo Trading?

At its core, NinjaTrader algo trading involves creating automated trading systems using the NinjaScript programming language within the NinjaTrader platform. These systems, often referred to as "strategies" or "indicators," are designed to analyze market data, identify trading opportunities based on predefined rules, and automatically execute trades without manual intervention.

Imagine a scenario where you have a well-defined trading strategy based on specific technical indicators. Instead of manually monitoring the market and executing trades, you can translate your strategy into a NinjaScript program. This program constantly monitors the market, looking for the conditions defined in your strategy. When those conditions are met, the program automatically sends the buy or sell order to your broker, ensuring you never miss a potentially profitable opportunity.
