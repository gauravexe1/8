This landscape is constantly evolving, driven by technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and the rise of digital marketing.

*   **Focus on Sustainability:** Increasingly, travelers are seeking eco-friendly and sustainable options. Highlighting your sustainability initiatives can attract environmentally conscious guests.

## Defining Your Target Audience

Before launching any advertising campaign, it's crucial to define your target audience. Understanding their demographics, psychographics, needs, and travel preferences will enable you to tailor your message and choose the most effective channels.

**Key Questions to Ask When Defining Your Target Audience:**

Creating detailed buyer personas can help you visualize your ideal customer and develop targeted messaging that resonates with their specific needs and desires.
