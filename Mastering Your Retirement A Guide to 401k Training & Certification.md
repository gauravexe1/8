## What is a 401(k)?

A 401(k) is a retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. It allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax salary to an investment account, which can then grow tax-deferred until retirement. Some employers also offer matching contributions, essentially giving you "free money" to boost your savings.

Here's a breakdown of the key features:

*   **Employee Contributions:** You choose how much of your salary to contribute, up to a certain limit set by the IRS each year.
*   **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically made before taxes, reducing your current taxable income. The earnings within the account also grow tax-deferred.
*   **Investment Options:** Your 401(k) plan will offer a range of investment options, such as mutual funds, stocks, and bonds.
*   **Employer Matching:** Many employers match a portion of employee contributions, incentivizing participation.
*   **Withdrawal Rules:** Withdrawals before age 59 Â½ are generally subject to a 10% penalty, plus income tax.

## Why 401(k) Training and Certification?
