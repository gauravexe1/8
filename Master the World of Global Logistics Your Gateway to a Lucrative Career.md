## What is Global Logistics?

Global logistics is much more than just moving products from point A to point B. It encompasses the planning, implementation, and control of the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of origin and the point of consumption to meet customers' requirements. This includes everything from sourcing raw materials to managing transportation, warehousing, customs clearance, and distribution, all while navigating the complexities of international regulations and cultural differences.
