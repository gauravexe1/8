They are responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team. This involves:

*   **Ensuring alignment with stakeholders:** Communicating the product vision and roadmap to stakeholders, gathering feedback, and incorporating it into the Product Backlog.
*   **Participating in Agile ceremonies:** Actively engaging in Scrum events like Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.
*   **Collaborating with the Development Team:** Working closely with the Development Team to clarify requirements, answer questions, and ensure that the product is being built to meet the defined vision.
*   **Accepting or rejecting completed work:** Reviewing completed user stories and features to ensure they meet the acceptance criteria and deliver the intended value.
